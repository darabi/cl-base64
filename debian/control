Description: Common Lisp package to encode and decode base64 with URI support
 This package provides highly optimized base64 encoding and decoding.
 Besides conversion to and from strings, integer conversions are supported.
 Encoding with Uniform Resource Indentifiers is supported by using
 a modified encoding table that uses only URI-compatible characters.
